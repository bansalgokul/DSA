To check for cycles in undirected graph - a undirected acyclic graph will always be a tree, if it contains more than n-1 edges, it is a cyclic graph.

Path - Contains lot of nodes and each of them is reachable. Each node can only appear once, and adjacent nodes in path should have a direct edge between them.

Degree of Node for undirected graph - total no of edges attached to node. Sum of degress of nodes = 2\* total no of edges

Degree of Node for undirected graph - Indegree - no of incoming edges, outdegree - no of outgoing edges. Sum of indegree + outdegress of nodes = 2\* total no of edges
